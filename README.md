CollapsibleTable
================

Table with collapsible sections - using a table for each section.  
This is a working sample that allows you to expand / collapse sections.  
The way it works is that you have a main table where the tableviewcells contain tables (they could contain any view).  The main table handles the logic of expanding / collapsing the sub-views.
